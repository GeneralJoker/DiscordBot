V1.0: Released on 30/12/2019 - It is very barebones at the moment 

Future update ideas: 

- Set the downvote threshold for deleting an image with a command ".limit" (Default is >3)
- Set the upvote threshold for pinning an image with a command ".pinat" (Default would be around ~ >15)
- Limiting the bot's actions to a single channel with a command ".isolate <channel_id>"
- Add a ".help" command listing all the available commands
